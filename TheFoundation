## Introduction
Good morning readers and welcome back to this cloud journey with me and my made-up company, Otsego Industries. The last time we were together, I had just created the account in AWS, gave my billing information, and then created the first Admin-level accounts to start building with, along with permissions and even an Admin group.  Now comes the fun part, creating the first VPC for Otsego.  Now let’s get to the meat of the issue.

## Prerequisites
When you first get into the cloud provider of your choice, you would think its just lift and shift your servers into the cloud and boom, it works! No issues, right?  Wrong.  That kind of thinking is something that we Administrators have had to impart to our users, our higher ups and indeed some of our fellow Administrators.  Just because you hear that moving to the cloud is easy, doesn’t mean you have to put in the work.  Before anything, you need to lay the foundation of your footprint into the cloud. What are you going to be need beforehand? Based on my own experience, yours may vary dear reader, this is what you will need:
o	The cloud provider of your choice
o	An account set up.
o	Username/password
