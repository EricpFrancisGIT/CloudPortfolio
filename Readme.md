##WHO AM I

I am a system administrator for a big company, Otsego Industries, with a rather large datacenter filled to the brim with storage arrays, server hardware, cabling, switches, core routers, back up tapes, server cabinets, being run 24x7x365.   The hardware is getting old, server licensing is getting to be expensive, my backup solution is starting to be a major cause of concern due to its age, and now my higher up (Director/manager) is saying that the next budget cycle won’t be as large/generous as I would like it to be and need to look at trimming expenses.  

I leave that meeting with that directive ringing in my mind, sitting back in my comfy gamer chair at work and think “we need to consolidate the datacenter, get rid of the old hardware.  I could look at virtualization, or even moving into the cloud”.  I get to work, doing research on the different cloud providers like Google, AWS, and MS Azure.  I then decide to at least see if AWS can meet my company’s needs and get to work on laying out the foundation of what could become the company datacenter in the cloud. 

Given that logic, I start looking at potentially splitting the company datacenter into a hybrid cloud; moving application development/testing along with quality assurance utilizing AWS as an Infrastructure as a Service platform while leaving sensitive company information housed within the company datacenter.  The first provider that I am going to be evaluating is going to be within Amazon Web Services.
